## About
`bwt-uploader` is a file uploader with support for pdf files, jpeg, png and bmp images written in Polymer. It follows a plug and play model with a few configurations needed to enable certain features. It is partially inspired by the vaadin uploader and came out as a result of a component we built at Blue Water Tracks. Images are converted to base64 images which might increase the size of the file by a small percentage.  

## Features
- Simple Drag and Drop along with browse option
- Ability to upload images and pdf files
- Down sample and resize images (optional)
- Ability to upload pdf files
- Preview of pdf and image files (just the first page in case of pdf files)
- Progress Bar
- Configurable AJAX options as well as ability to insert extra fields into the upload object
- Ability to skip downsampling of image
- Configurable maximum file size
- Customizable CSS and shape of preview area

## Installation
To install `bower install bwt-uploader`

To run the code, head into the component's folder and run `polymer serve`

To run the tests `polymer test`
